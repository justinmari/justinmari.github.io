                    Oh look it's me. My name is Justin Mari Maliwat, and I guess you could say this is my portfolio site to, you know, show off what I can do.
                    I'm super passionate in designing and programming pretty looking things, which hopefully shows through the design, layout, and styling of this site.
                    I thought I'd use this space to take a break from some of the professional jargon and show off my interests.
                    After all, we are humans and not robots (right?).

                    <p>
                        The first spark that sent me spiraling into my interest in game design was learning how to create a simple RPG using RPGMaker (I'm a big fan of Undertale). 
                        This led to many early projects of mine, which ranged from Unity tutorials (Top-Down Space Shooter) to spontaneous bouts of wanting to code (Friend-Inspired Sidescroller Game).
                        Using my highschool programming classes along with my earlier projects, I developed a solid foundation in the programming basics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Front end development hooked me into the world of web development and web design. 
                        Once I have discovered the use of JavaScript in combination with the &lt;canvas&gt; element, I realized the vast possibilities when it comes to sleek visuals and animations.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        I was never really a coffee person until I ended up as a part-time coffee barista at a café.
                        Espresso brewing caught my eye the most, which led to me investing in my own espresso setup at home.
                        Though the process of brewing good espresso was a long and difficult journey, I eventually found the balance that best suited my taste.
                        I mainly enjoy drinking specialty espresso drinks, but I get the most joy when making them for others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've purchased the Breville Barista Express, which is one of the best purchases I've ever made.
                        I can create lattes with nice latte art, as well as grind and dial in my espresso to the taste of my liking.
                        If you're looking for a machine, I highly recommend it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do want to expand my horizons into other coffee brewing techniques, and, to go even further beyond, cocktail mixing.
                        But then I thought: "Okay you know what, the amount of money I'd need for all the tools and ingredients... no thanks."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is my easiest escape when it comes to dealing with stress.
                        Games can start hurting my head when I've used up too much mental capacity on them.
                        But playing the guitar comes naturally to me so it doesn't have the same effect.
                        I enjoy learning music theory, learning new songs, as well as singing along to them.
                        It has always been a dream for me to perform for others, but I think the feeling of stage fright is still at large within me.

                    <p>
                        If there's any way to develop trust, teamwork, and leadership (I'm looking at you hiring manager), hosting a participating in boardgames and cardgames are an excellent tool.
                        Some games I've really come to love are:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="no-bullets">
                        <li>Exploding Kittens</li>
                        <li>Betrayal at House on the Hill</li>
                        <li>Codenames</li>
                        <li>Risk</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        These games really brought my family and friends together, especially during the pandemic where everyone is stuck inside their homes.
                        As much as I love competitive games such as Risk and Exploding Kittens, I enjoy co-operative games more such as Betrayal at House on the Hill.

                        Videogames are great, but they would be even better when played with friends.
                        Minecraft was the catalyst towards me learning about server hosting and the basics of how ports work on a router.
                        Using this knowledge, I was able to teach myself about the general idea of LANs and WLANs, which have enabled my friends to play together in many games.
                        Some dedicated servers I have hosted were for Minecraft, Garrys Mod, Terraria, and Starbound.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        With a passion for music, I picked up music production as a hobby.
                        Many things led me to where I am now in terms of being musically inclined, most notably the game called
                        Elite Beat Agents on the Nintendo DS.
                        It allowed me to develop my rhythm, which ultimately led to my interest in GarageBand, Osu, and the guitar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, I bought FL Studio and began writing songs and producing beats for me and my friends for fun.
                        My favourite things to do were to toy with the various instruments, play with the settings on Equalizers,
                        and have fun with autotune and other vocal adjustment programs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although I've produced a good amount of tracks, I still have a long way to go if I want to create something that sounds industry standard.
                        Maybe I'll show off something here. Maybe.
